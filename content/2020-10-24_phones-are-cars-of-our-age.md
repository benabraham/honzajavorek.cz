I think cars are to our ancestors what the internet and mobile phones are to us. A revolutionary enabler, which gradually but completely changes everything in human lives. I have not done any real research about this, so feel free to call this thought of mine to be nonsense which isn't supported by any historical or contemporary evidence.

I'm over 30 and my grandparents are over 80. They lived through the WW2 and all the Cold War years after that. They remember how the floor in their house was clay when they were kids. They tell long stories about how their everyday life looked like.

## The rise of the car

One thing I noticed in their narration is the slow approach of technologies we assume as granted today. How they first walked everywhere they needed. Trains have existed, but were expensive, and weren't really a solution to any problems common people used to have. Then, at some point, some of the grandfathers invested in getting motorcycles. From the stories it's apparent this was perceived as outlandish at first and they've had to come up with various excuses and reasoning on why it's so important for the family to have it. Clearly, they were early adopters, similar to people playing with the internet 20 years ago or getting 3D printers a few years back. They were not sure yet what it's good for, but they were excited about it. They subconsciously felt the potential behind it.

Later on, they started buying cars. The first car seems to be an important moment, but not as notable as the first motorcycle. In their stories, it seems like an obvious upgrade, hold back perhaps by their budget more than by understanding what it is good for. After that, the life of the family is all about cars and things they couldn't do before that, like a self-organized vacation at the Black Sea coast (Eastern Bloc family). Fast forward to modern days, my 88 years old grandpa still drives his car. He drives it to do shopping, he regularly drives it 4 km to the community garden. He says he hasn't been on a train for more than 20 years and I assume his attitude towards any public transport is similar. He doesn't have a reason to behave differently. Since the moment he got his first car, he's been able to get everything done he ever needed using just cars.

The world has changed from the ground up during his lifetime. In the beginning, people lived only in their villages and their moving range was limited by what was possible to walk or perhaps cycle. He started with a motorcycle and in a few decades, it wasn't a completely long stretch for him to load his family to a car and go 1500 km for vacation. In a similar manner, everything around changed, too. To accommodate cars, roads have been built everywhere. Streets got parking places. The infrastructure materialized.

During the lifetime of my parents, cars were already normal. Transport has made the world  interconnected and smaller, unparalleled to anything before. People do weekend trips to nearby mountains, commute longer distances, move to villages in a distance from towns where they work, have their family further away, have a cottage in a distant region, buy stuff in shopping malls. Because all of that is suddenly possible. Satellite villages, suburban sprawl, rush hours, and parking problems materialize. So many things we know today and consider normal wouldn't be possible at all without cars. The grandparents were there when it all started, but it's our parents who got the most out of all the changes. For them, a car is an inseparable part of their lives. Something which allowed them to live the way they did. I don't think any other recent invention has been as enabling as the car is. Not even TV.

## The rise of the phone

My generation has been there when the internet and computers started. I think we're in a similar situation as our grandparents. In the beginning, it was just for early adopters, but later, everyone learned the potential of these technologies. Computers were like motorcycles. The true changes started when smartphones came. They're the cars of our age and we're yet to see how our kids are going to stretch their potential to the maximum, and to discover all controversies and problems these things have. We'll live and die with the feeling that smartphones are a privilege of progress, but our kids will have it as something completely normal, which allows them to live the way they do.

I think the change caused by the internet and smartphones is really similar in how radically different behavior and lifestyle it enables. The internet has made the world  even more interconnected and much smaller than transport.

## Changes in culture

One of the ways it's possible to realize the amount of changes we're experiencing is by watching older movies. You can basically divide them as movies before smartphones and after them, because the former suddenly don't make sense anymore. Their plots wouldn't work today. We'd be able to work them out using a few chat messages from our phones or a couple of clicks (taps?!) in the browser. If our grandparents made and watched more movies, I think they'd see a similar divide.

One thing they definitely had to experience though, is the emergence of motor sport. I imagine that earlier the word sport encompassed mostly physical activities, but suddenly there this strange motorized equipment controlled by individuals, whose reflexes were more important than muscles. Did people protest that motor sport isn't really a sport? For me as a kid, watching HÃ¤kkinen competing with Schumacher in F1 was a completely normal Sunday fun. Perhaps this is something similar to what we see in professional gaming becoming a thing called esport? Will our kids watch pro gamers on Sundays?

## Changes in progress

I live at a central place in a rather large European city with excellent public transport, so I don't need to own a car. In fact, it would be more difficult to own it than not, especially given there are things like carsharing today. I also often take advantage of the fact that everyone else has cars.

Most people don't live like that, though, and if I lived at a different place, I'd probably own a car, too. To be honest, given how most things work, it would be probably very unpleasant to live somewhere else without a car. As most people are car-enabled, the world is arranged as such. As a sole customer, I couldn't return small corner shops to the village where my house would be. Everyone uses their cars to shop in the malls far away from where they live.

When I imagine I live somewhere else than in a central city, and I think of cars as an enabler similar to smartphones, it's not that difficult to empathize with people who have cars. And perhaps even those who _like_ their cars! Especially if they're older than me and they lived through the car boom. They perceive cars as undeniable progress, as an enabler of a better life. In their eyes, attempts to limit cars are attempts to limit well-being. People who live 30 km far from the place where they work couldn't live like this. They couldn't have their house. Either they'd be there, but working on a field, or they'd need to live in a flat downtown. Cars and all the basic transport infrastructure caused a lot of places offer a lot more opportunities than before. A lot more people are wealthier thanks to cars.

The internet continues the trend. There are people remotely working from distant mountain villages. There are digital nomads. The shopping malls actually become obsolete with people shopping both groceries and clothing on-line. The COVID-19 pandemic is going to push this even further. At some point of all the lockdowns, the delivery companies can actually become the majority of cars in the streets.

Maybe the cars will be powered by electricity, but they're going to stay as a crucial enabler. Many of our needs will move on-line, we'll stay at home a lot more, but cars will be the thing which will make them happen in the real world. Instead of people using cars to commute, more and more things will get delivered by cars directly to their homes, possibly widening the range of places with more opportunities than before. Possibly making even more people wealthier.

How many people will need to own a private car in such an environment? Who knows, depends on how effective public transport, car rentals, and car-sharing will become. Will private cars become more expensive? Will they become yachts for weekend trips? Will a driving license turn into something people only have for fun, similar to Yachtmaster?

## Backlash

In modern cities of Europe there's a backlash against cars. The local governments turn roads to pavements, build cycling paths, try to get pedestrians back to squares. It's something that's hardly usable anywhere else than in a large city. People out of the city got their quality of life using cars, especially in countries larger than, let's say, Netherlands. There's never going to be enough public transport to make this trend relevant for people living in regional villages. It's a trend only people in central locations in large cities can afford, I think.

Is it possible there will be a similar trend regarding current tech? Will hipsters start demanding physical stores again? Will they pull out optical cables from central quarters, install Wi-Fi and 5G jammers? What would be the values behind that? Privacy? Disconnect from notifications? Mindfulness? We think cars are dangerous and smell bad. Perhaps our kids will think that surveillance, notifications, and sophisticated ads are unhealthy and will start paying for their single-origin coffee with cash again. Will I become the old fart who wants to keep his technical advancements and will I vote against my kids? Will the [Green Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_(Czech_Republic)) move on to fight for a digital detox, while a techno-optimistic [Pirate Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Pirate_Party) becomes a defender of "conservative values" the same way right-wing parties sport car-first policies today?

## Thanks for reading

I don't know if this all makes much sense. As I mentioned in the beginning, this is not researched at all. I'm not a scientist nor a science fiction writer. I'm just a random software engineer from the Czech Republic who has decided to elaborate on a [shower thought](https://www.reddit.com/r/showerthoughts/) and publish an article on the topic on his personal blog. Feel free to point out how wrong I am or build on top of my ideas further. In the latter case, a Kindle version of your published novel would be enough as thanks.

I really think the analogy has some grounds though. And thinking about it definitely helped me a lot in understanding different people's opinions and lifestyles. Especially those older than me and those with cars.
